When
toggled using the button below, the menu will change. Make sure to keep all
page
content within the <code>#page-content-wrapper</code>. The top navbar is
optional,
and just for demonstration. Just create an element with the
<code>#menu-toggle</code> ID which will toggle the menu when clicked. If
youâ€™re
using navs to provide a
navigation bar, be sure to add a role="navigation" to the most logical
parent
container of the ul or wrap a nav element around the whole navigation. Do
not
add the role to the itself, as this would prevent it from being announced as
an actual list by assistive technologies.
